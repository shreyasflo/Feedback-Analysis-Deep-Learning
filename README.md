# Problem Description

The dataset contains data of feedback given by the numerous customers

There are 5 categories: 'Bug', 'Comments', 'Complaints', 'Meaningless', 'Requests'.

I have build a deep learning model to predict the categories of each feedback.

# Inspiration
One inspiration for developing this model is that the data has an undersampling problem which makes it more interasting to solve.
